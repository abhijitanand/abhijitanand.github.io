excerpt: 'This study addresses the challenge of ranking hard queries in text systems by enriching them with relevant documents and fine-tuning a specialized ranker for these queries. By combining relevance scores from the specialized and base rankers, along with query performance scores, the method achieves significant improvements of up to 25% on passage ranking and up to 48.4% on document ranking tasks compared to baseline approaches, outperforming even state-of-the-art models.'
