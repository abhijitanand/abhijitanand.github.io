excerpt: 'This paper proposes a simple yet effective method to improve ranking performance on smaller datasets using supervised contrastive learning for the document ranking problem. We perform data augmentation by creating training data using parts of the relevant documents in the query-document pairs. We then use a supervised contrastive learning objective to learn an effective ranking model from the augmented dataset. Our experiments on subsets of the TREC-DL dataset show that, although data augmentation leads to an increasing the training data sizes, it does not necessarily improve the performance using existing pointwise or pairwise training'
