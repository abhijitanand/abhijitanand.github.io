title: "NUMTEMP: A real-world benchmark to verify claims with statistical and temporal expressions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-01-01-numtemp.md
excerpt: 'Automated fact checking has gained immense interest to tackle the growing misinformation in the digital era. Existing systems primarily focus on synthetic claims on Wikipedia, and noteworthy progress has also been made on real-world claims. In this work, we release Numtemp, a diverse, multi-domain dataset focused exclusively on numerical claims, encompassing temporal, statistical and diverse aspects with fine-grained metadata and an evidence collection without leakage. This addresses the challenge of verifying real-world numerical claims, which are complex and often lack precise information, not addressed by existing works that mainly focus on synthetic claims. We evaluate and quantify the limitations of existing solutions for the task of verifying numerical claims.'

Automated fact checking has gained immense interest to tackle the growing misinformation in the digital era.
