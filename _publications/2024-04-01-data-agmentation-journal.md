collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-04-01-data-agmentation-journal.md
excerpt: 'The paper proposes data augmentation methods to boost the performance of contextual ranking models, which often demand substantial data for fine-tuning. Through supervised and unsupervised augmentation, relevant document segments in query-document pairs are utilized to enhance sample efficiency, particularly with limited training data. By adapting contrastive losses, the model effectively leverages augmented data, yielding a more robust and effective ranking model for document ranking tasks.'

The paper proposes data augmentation methods to boost the performance of contextual ranking models, which often demand substantial data for fine-tuning. Through supervised and unsupervised augmentation, relevant document segments in query-document pairs are utilized to enhance sample efficiency, particularly with limited training data. By adapting contrastive losses, the model effectively leverages augmented data, yielding a more robust and effective ranking model for document ranking tasks.
