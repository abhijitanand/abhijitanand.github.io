Hey, 

My name is Abhijit, and I have finished my PhD from Leibniz University Hannover, Germany. My research focused on Search and Ranking, giving me extensive expertise across a range of areas, including retrieval methods (sparse, dense, RAG), transformer models for sparse and dense/contextual representations, model distillation, multi-task and curriculum learning, reinforcement learning, intent classification, offline evaluation, and dataset creation. I have successfully applied these methodologies in my work, leading to results that have been rigorously peer-reviewed and published in prestigious conferences.

<!---Prior to my academic pursuits, I accumulated over 8 years of industry experience, including 3+ years as a Data Scientist/ML Engineer and 5+ years as a Software Engineer/Team Lead. In these roles, I led data science teams, acted as a proxy Product Owner for data-driven products, and contributed across diverse domains such as Mobility, professional networking, healthcare, and finance. I have navigated projects of varying scales and team structures--->

I have over 10 years of industry experience and currently work at Mbition, where I help build conversational AI products. My role involves enabling teams to integrate ML/AI into their solutions, driving AI adoption across teams, and shaping the development of intelligent, user-focused technologies. Iâ€™m passionate about bridging cutting-edge research and real-world applications, with a focus on making AI more accessible, impactful, and practical.
