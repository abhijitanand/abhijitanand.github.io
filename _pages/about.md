Hey, 

My name is Abhijit and I am currently working to obtain my PhD from Leibniz University in Hannover, Germany. My research focuses is on enhancing Text Search and Ranking using Large Language Models. Currently, my interests mainly focus on: 
* Improving text ranking in a resource scarce setting.
* Improving ranking of hard/difficult queries.
* Creating benchmark datset for intent ranking.
* Undertanding deep learning models.
If you are interested and want to discuss these topics, feel free to send me an email!
