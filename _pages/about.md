Hey, 

My name is Abhijit and I am currently working to obtain my PhD from Leibniz University in Hannover, Germany. My research focus on search and ranking has equipped me with extensive expertise in various areas including Retrieval (sparse, dense, RAG), transformer models for sparse and dense/contextual representations, model distillation, Multi-Task Learning, Curriculum Learning, and Reinforcement Learning, Intent Classification, offline evaluation, dataset creation. I have successfully integrated these methodologies into my work, which has been rigorously peer-reviewed and published in prestigious conferences.

Prior to my academic pursuits, I accumulated over 8 years of industry experience, including 3+ years as a Data Scientist/ML Engineer and 5+ years as a Software Engineer/Team Lead. In these roles, I led data science teams, acted as a proxy Product Owner for data-driven products, and contributed across diverse domains such as Mobility, professional networking, healthcare, and finance. I have navigated projects of varying scales and team structures
